# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Hello! This is the day 0 of the 100 Days Of Code challenge! I will be studying Laravel and other technologies that are included in the TALL Stack. Hope this log and the projects I will be doing helps anyone pursuing the same goals I am. If you want to reach me, feel free to follow me on Twitter. See you tomorrow!

### Day 1: January 18, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a Laravel Blog project. My idea is to use Laravel Components to build the layout, because I never used them in a project before. I created a Navbar component and stylized it using Bootstrap 5.

**Thoughts**: It was very cool to use Laravel components for the first time, because they are very easy to use and can make a lot easier to build the layout of my app.

### Day 2: January 19, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Changed the navbar colors and the <a> titles on the blog. Created a Post card to be displayed on the home page, linking to the full post. I'm still working only on the front-end.
  
**Thoughts**: I chose a color palette yesterday but implementing it on the blog makes me think it doesn't suit correctly. I will try it out another one in the next few days. The home page is not responsive yet. Hope Bootstrap helps me in this matter.

### Day 3: January 20, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing Laravel Breeze into the project.
