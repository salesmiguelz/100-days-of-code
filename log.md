# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Hello! This is the day 0 of the 100 Days Of Code challenge! I will be studying Laravel and other technologies that are included in the TALL Stack. Hope this log and the projects I will be doing helps anyone pursuing the same goals I am. If you want to reach me, feel free to follow me on Twitter. See you tomorrow!

### Day 1: January 18, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a Laravel Blog project. My idea is to use Laravel Components to build the layout, because I never used them in a project before. I created a Navbar component and stylized it using Bootstrap 5.

**Thoughts**: It was very cool to use Laravel components for the first time, because they are very easy to use and can make a lot easier to build the layout of my app.

### Day 2: January 19, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Changed the navbar colors and the <a> titles on the blog. Created a Post card to be displayed on the home page, linking to the full post. I'm still working only on the front-end.
  
**Thoughts**: I chose a color palette yesterday but implementing it on the blog makes me think it doesn't suit correctly. I will try it out another one in the next few days. The home page is not responsive yet. Hope Bootstrap helps me in this matter.

### Day 3: January 20, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing Laravel Breeze into the project. 
  
**Thoughts**: Today I was pretty tired from college so I didn't improve some features that I was planning to work. The front-end is pretty messy, but Bootstrap is helping me a lot.
  
### Day 4: January 21, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Created a logout button with Laravel Breeze and a Posts model, controller and table.
  
### Day 5: January 22, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Developed fully dynamic posts system, where you can write title, description and body. The posts will be filtered by user. Also created a One to Many relantionship between User and Post.
  
### Day 6: January 23, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Changed the "/" route to redirect to "/posts" with a list of posts from all users. Created a delete button that makes it possible for the logged user to delete his posts and made the "My Posts" section filtering the posts by the logged user.
  
### Day 7: January 24, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing custom images on the blog posts. I had some trouble understanding Storage::put method and which parameters I should pass to it, but th files are now being saved properly.
  
**Thoughts**: I made it to the first week of the challenge! I learned a lot in this past 7 days and I'm more excited than ever to learn more about Laravel and build amazing things!
  
### Day 8: January 25, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Created edit and updated method for the blog posts. Now all post images are displayed properly and saved or deleted in the DB.
  
### Day 9: January 26, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Created show method and fixed image not being deleted when a post is deleted. Starting to create an admin panel to manage users and categories.

### Day 10: January 27, 2022.
