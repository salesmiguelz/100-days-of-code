# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Hello! This is the day 0 of the 100 Days Of Code challenge! I will be studying Laravel and other technologies that are included in the TALL Stack. Hope this log and the projects I will be doing helps anyone pursuing the same goals I am. If you want to reach me, feel free to follow me on Twitter. See you tomorrow!

### Day 1: January 18, 2022.

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a Laravel Blog project. My idea is to use Laravel Components to build the layout, because I never used them in a project before. I created a Navbar component and stylized it using Bootstrap 5.

**Thoughts**: It was very cool to use Laravel components for the first time, because they are very easy to use and can make a lot easier to build the layout of my app.
